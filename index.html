        <p>Orange leaves were swirling around the street this morning like it was going to storm. Then the light came through just as my buddy Jake picked me up to roller skate at the park.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        He's got this loud, grumbling little pickup w/ a sticker that says LIGHTNING on the side. I love riding around in it.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I fell on my ankle pretty bad trying to do a crossover backwards. I set it on a bag of frozen corn for a bit. It's totally fine now.

        My boyfriend Michael made some money on cloudflare stock, and he's pretty pumped.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Look how cute he is.

       Also, I woke up this morning with <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljTQVyWJ8uA">this</a> song stuck in my head:
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Oh, how your bubble's gonna burst <br/>
      When you meet another nurse <br/>
      She'll be driving in a hearse <br/>
      <br/>
      You're gonna need a heap of glue <br/>
      When they all catch up with you <br/>
      And they cut you up in two <br/>
      <br/>
      Now your ears are ringing <br/>
      The birds have stopped their singing <br/>
      Everything is turning grey <br/>
